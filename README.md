# E-commerce site
Project made for IDG2003 Back-end development.

# How to set up
To operate this website, you need to first set up a database using the DATABASE.txt provided in the data folder.
(Originally set up using a MySQL database.)

When first launching, head to the login.php page to let the site generate an admin account.
You can then login as follows:
username: admin
password: 0admin0

This allows you to add products to the site on the admin page, which can be ordered by users.
Users can create accounts, look at products, add these to cart & order these.
